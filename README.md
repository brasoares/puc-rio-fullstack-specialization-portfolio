# Full Stack Development Specialization - PUC-Rio Portfolio

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio for my **Full Stack Development Specialization** at PUC-Rio. It showcases practical projects, exercises, and key learning materials developed throughout the program, demonstrating a robust understanding of both front-end and back-end web technologies.

## About the Specialization Program

The PUC-Rio's Full Stack Development Specialization is an intensive **9-month, 360-hour postgraduate Lato Sensu program**. It is designed to equip professionals with cutting-edge skills for creating intelligent, full-stack solutions. The curriculum balances theoretical foundations with hands-on application, emphasizing market-relevant technologies and agile methodologies through practical sprints and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) deliveries.

The program is **100% online with live sessions** and features a highly qualified faculty from PUC-Rio and industry guest speakers, ensuring a practical, "hands-on" learning experience.

**Program Structure:**
The course is structured into **3 main modules (Sprints)**, each lasting 11 weeks and totaling 120 hours. Each Sprint includes three 30-hour disciplines and a 30-hour MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development discipline. These MVPs substitute the traditional final thesis (TCC), fostering practical application of learned concepts. Exceptional MVPs may even be presented at an event in partnership with MIT Technology Review Brasil.

**My Foundational Sprint (Transition/Refresher):**
Currently, I am completing the optional **"Transition Sprint" (Sprint do Zero ao CÃ³digo)**. This foundational module provides a robust base in core programming concepts, web page construction, and database fundamentals. While serving as an excellent introduction for those new to the field or in career transition, I am utilizing it as a valuable opportunity to **review, solidify, and deepen my understanding of these essential building blocks** before diving into the advanced Sprints.

## Covered Technologies & Core Concepts

This specialization provides deep dives into a wide array of tools and principles, structured across key development areas, as outlined in the program's curriculum:

**Programming Languages & Runtimes:**

**Back-end Development:**
* RESTful APIs Implementation
* Microservices Architecture 
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & SOLID Principles 
* Clean Code & Best Practices
* MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)
* Authentication & Authorization

**Databases:**
* SQL Databases 
    * Database Modeling (Conceptual, Logical, Physical Design) 
    * Basic DDL Commands (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) 
    * Basic SQL Commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) 
* NoSQL Databases

**Cloud & DevOps:**
* Cloud Architecture 
* Docker & Containerization (as implied by DevOps and MVP examples)
* DevOps Principles
* CI/CD Pipelines (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
* Deployment & Testing Environments

**Methodologies & Tools:**
* Agile Methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
* Git & GitHub
* Testing Frameworks
* API Testing (e.g., Postman, Insomnia)
* Understanding Programming vs. Diagramming

## Repository Structure

* `courses/`: Contains projects and practical exercises organized by specialization modules/disciplines. Each subfolder includes its own `README.md` detailing the project, technologies used, and how to run it.
* `projects/`: Larger, often integrative projects or MVPs developed during the specialization, representing complete applications or significant features.
* `notes/`: Personal study notes, summaries of key concepts, and cheat sheets from the program.
* `certifications/`: Official certificates and proofs of completion related to the specialization (if necessary accordingly with the types and the information they contain; I'll take a look at the need).
* `resources/`: Curated list of useful links, articles, and supplementary learning materials.
