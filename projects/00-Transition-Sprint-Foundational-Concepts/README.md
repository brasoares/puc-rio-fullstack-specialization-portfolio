# 00-Transition-Sprint-Foundational-Concepts: Web Development Fundamentals

This directory contains the projects and exercises from the **Transition Sprint (Sprint do Zero ao CÃ³digo)**, focusing on foundational concepts in web development, programming with Python, and database basics. This sprint is crucial for building a solid understanding of the core technologies that underpin full-stack development.

The web development portion of this sprint evolves through a series of practical lessons, culminating in the development of the "Whac-A-Mole" game. Each lesson introduces new concepts, progressively enhancing the project.

## Lesson Projects & Evolution:

This sprint's web development content is structured around the following key lessons:

### 1. Introduction to HTML Page Construction with CSS (`01-intro-html-css-pages/`)
* **Focus:** Understanding web servers, clients, HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and the fundamental role of HTML for structuring web content.
* **Project Progression:** The "Whac-A-Mole" game begins its construction here, primarily using basic HTML tags to establish its core structure. Files for CSS and JavaScript folders may be present but contain initial setup or placeholders for later development in this stage.
* **Project Link:** [Project for Aula 1](01-intro-html-css-pages/README.md)

### 2. Stylesheets with CSS and Responsiveness (`02-css-responsiveness-project/`)
* **Focus:** Mastering CSS for controlling the presentation and layout of HTML elements, including styling properties and responsiveness techniques.
* **Project Progression:** The "Whac-A-Mole" game is enhanced in this stage with CSS stylesheets to define its visual appearance and ensure a responsive layout across various devices.
* **Project Link:** [Project for Aula 2](02-css-responsiveness-project/README.md)

### 3. JavaScript (`03-javascript-interactivity-project/`)
* **Focus:** Introducing JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamism to web pages, enabling real-time content manipulation, form validation, and user interactions.
* **Project Progression:** The "Whac-A-Mole" game becomes fully interactive, with game logic, scoring, and user input mechanisms implemented using JavaScript. This brings the game to full functionality.
* **Project Link:** [Project for Aula 3](03-javascript-interactivity-project/README.md)

## Culminating Project: Whac-A-Mole Game (`whac-a-mole-final-sprint-project/`)

This folder contains the **complete and fully functional version of the Whac-A-Mole game** as developed throughout this foundational sprint. It integrates all the concepts from HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactivity, serving as a comprehensive demonstration of basic full-stack web development skills acquired in this module.
