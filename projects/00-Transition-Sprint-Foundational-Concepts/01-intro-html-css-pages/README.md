# Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML Page Construction with CSS - Whac-A-Mole Project (Initial Phase)

This directory contains the "Whac-A-Mole" project in the state it was developed during **Lesson 1 of the Transition Sprint: Introduction to HTML Page Construction with CSS**.

## Focus of Lesson 1:
* **Fundamental Concepts:** This lesson covered the introduction to web servers, clients, HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and the essential role of HTML for structuring web page content.
* **Basic Project Structure:** In this phase, the "Whac-A-Mole" game's basic structure was built using **only HTML tags**. The focus was on organizing the page elements, such as the board, holes, scoreboard, and start button, without applying complex visual styles or JavaScript interactivity.

## State of the "Whac-A-Mole" Project in This Phase:
* The project here represents the **initial version of the game**, with the fundamental HTML markup.
* Folders for CSS and JavaScript (`css/`, `javascript/`) may be present but contain only configuration files or placeholders for future development in upcoming lessons. **No interactive functionality or advanced styling is implemented at this stage.**

## Next Steps:
This project will be progressively enhanced in subsequent lessons, where the following will be added:
* Styling and responsiveness with CSS (Lesson 2).
* Interactivity and game logic with JavaScript (Lesson 3).
